Oh, you wanna about violence? Well would you like to remind me who shot who the first time we met?
Oh it was when I was still living in the warehouse, I remember dearly.
I remember you breaking down the door, shining a light in my face, yelling at me to get away from the kid.
Only you didn’t even give me the chance to 'get away from the kid'.
Because you didn’t ask who I was, who the kid was, or why we were hiding out the rain and sharing food from the trash together.
Ah memories, it brings a tear to my eye.
Literally.
I still have nightmares where I’m crawling away from you with a bullet in my leg and Tox screaming.
Why? Because you’re the living embodiment of the “shoot first ask questions later” kinda cop.
You sons of bitches only care about keeping the prisons full and the hobos off the streets.
You all deserve every violent thing anyone's ever done to you.
And I swear to god if you lay a finger on Tox I will slaughter every one of you dogs with my bare hands.
You know what? That’s all I needed to hear.
You’re a lost cause.
(You gesture to the officers on the other side of one way glass, they come in and routinely cuff him back up and bring him out into the hall)
