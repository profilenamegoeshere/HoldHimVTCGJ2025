Scumbag? I may not remember much about Tox but I do remember that I practically raised him after what happened.
The only scumbag here is the one who imprisons the people who are out on the street, struggling for survival.
The one who locks em in a box and throws away the key, who proclaims they’re a protector of their beautiful city and its citizens.
And not trusting? puh-lease.
Tox trusted me with his life. To protect him from you.
Can you say that about yourself?
Does anybody in this city actually trust you?
Or do they just do what you say so you don’t beat the shit out of them?
Well I could say that about me and Tox y’know. That we could trust each other.
And you took that from me.
He’s out there somewhere. Alone. Cold. Hungry.
And if he stays that way, one day he’s just gonna be another name on your list.
Another key for you to throw away.
(You barely noticed how close to your face he had gotten)
Wait… 
You… fed him?
How else do you think he survived so long without parents?
If you give me a few days I can figure out a way drop the charges. I’ll look after him until then.
Ah-! I … what?
(You put a hand on his shoulder and reassure him on your word, and turn to leave before he can ask why or he can see your cloudy eyes)
The End
