*sigh* Anyway, what’s on the interrogation menu today?
That was rhetorical.
I know what you want.
And you know that I know.
And you also know that you won’t get it.
Because you ALSO also know that my brain’s way too far gone for either of us to get it.
So I guess my real question is … why are you here?
