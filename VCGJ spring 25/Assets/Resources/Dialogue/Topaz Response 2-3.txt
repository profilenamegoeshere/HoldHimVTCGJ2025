Yeah and you know what would make me a lot more stable?
If I could die knowing I did at least one goddamn good deed in my life.
But you don’t think I can.
Nobody can.
And my only chance at proving you all wrong is probably dead by now. And probably by your hands.
Look me in the eyes and tell me he’s still alive.
(You genuinely don't know what happened to him after the fight, you were too focused on Topaz)
(And even if you did, you're still busy processing what he's saying to respond properly)
(But before you can snap out of it and tell him, he assumes the worst)
No… no no no no no NO.
YOU MOTHERFUCKERS.
HE WAS THE ONE THING I HAD.
I WAS THE ONE THING HE HAD.
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANNA SEE UNSTABLE.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW UNSTABLE I AM WITHOUT HIM.
(He reaches for your gun, you hadn’t realized how close you had gotten in the heat of the argument)
(Before you can fully react he pulls it out, you manage to grab his hand before he can point it any one)
(But his adrenaline was stronger than your training)
(He manages to tip the barrel just enough)
(Just not the direction you were expecting)
BANG
(His brains splatter on the wall and ceiling)
(Leaving you alone in utter silence)
The End
